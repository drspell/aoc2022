### Open and Read a File in Python
[Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_open.asp)  

__Note 1::__ When you read the lines of a file the data type that you read in will be a `String`.  

__Note 2::__ When you read in a line from a file each line has a hidden character at the end of the string. This character is `the new line character, \n`. This character represents hittig the `return` key. In python you can call the `strip()` method on a string to remove blanks and newline characters before and after a string. 

For example:

```
a = "This will print this sentence and then a new line\n"
b = a.strip()

print(a, len(a))
print(b, len(b))

# Outputs
This will print this sentence and then a new line
 50
This will print this sentence and then a new line 49
```

## Hints

1. Create 2 text files, one for the sample input and one for your specific puzzle input  
2. Write your code to solve the puzzle for the sample input  
3. Make sure that you calculate totals for 5 elves in the sample data
4. Think about a simple test that you could write to check for a blank line.
